# dpda-ones-double-zeros
DPDA recognizing the language L = { w ∈ {0, 1}* | n₁(w) = 2 · n₀(w) }

This repository contains a detailed Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPDA) specifically constructed to recognize the binary language where the count of ones is exactly double the count of zeros. (including the empty string)
